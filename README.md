# hf-application

Hello! I'm excited to apply for the Huggingface Cloud ML Engineer role. This repository is the result of my work on the
take home assignment. I have documented any implementations in the problem directories in this repository. The general
starting point for my problem solutions should be to just read the README files in the respective directory.

- [Problem 1 - Design and deploy a cloud-based machine learning application](problem_1)
- [Problem 2 - Resuming Training](problem_2)
- [Problem 3 - Container Creation and Testing Exercise](problem_3)

If there are any questions about my design decisions, please feel free to reach out to me at matt@mattjalvarez.com
